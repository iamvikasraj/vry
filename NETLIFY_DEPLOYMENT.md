# Netlify Deployment Guide

## Quick Fix Applied âœ…

Your project structure has been fixed! The issue was that your `package.json` was configured for a React/Vite build, but you have a static HTML site.

## What Was Fixed

1. **Removed Vite configuration** - Deleted `vite.config.js` since you don't need it
2. **Updated package.json** - Removed React dependencies and build commands
3. **Created netlify.toml** - Added proper Netlify configuration for static sites
4. **Fixed favicon path** - Corrected the favicon reference in HTML

## How to Deploy to Netlify

### Option 1: Drag & Drop (Easiest)
1. Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
2. Log in to your account
3. Drag your entire project folder to the deploy area
4. Your site will be live instantly!

### Option 2: Git Integration (Recommended)
1. Push your changes to GitHub
2. Connect your GitHub repo to Netlify
3. Netlify will auto-deploy on every push

### Option 3: Netlify CLI
```bash
# Install Netlify CLI
npm install -g netlify-cli

# Login to Netlify
netlify login

# Deploy from your project directory
netlify deploy --prod --dir=.
```

## Project Structure (Now Correct)

```
vry/
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html          # Main HTML file
â”œâ”€â”€ styles.css          # Main CSS file
â”œâ”€â”€ assets/             # Static assets
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ favicon/        # Favicon files
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ video/          # Video files
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ *.svg           # Icon files
â”œâ”€â”€ experiments.html    # Experiments page
â”œâ”€â”€ netlify.toml        # Netlify configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json        # Updated for static site
â””â”€â”€ README.md
```

## Build Settings for Netlify

- **Build command**: (leave empty - no build needed)

- **Node version**: 18 (optional, for any Node tools)

## Testing Locally

Your site should now work perfectly on Netlify! ðŸŽ‰
